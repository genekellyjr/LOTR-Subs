Let us hope that our presence

167
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,823
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

...or jewels...

...but mithril.

170

Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

-Oh, that was a kingly gift.

-It's Gollum.

181
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,931
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

182
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,310
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
-Escaped...

183
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,646
...or was set loose.

184
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,817
Now the Ring has brought him here.

185
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,197
He will never be rid of his need for it.

186

He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

Sméagol's life is a sad story.

188
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:20,297
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

189
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,009
Before it drove him mad.

190
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,179
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

191
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,556
Pity?

192
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,518
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

193
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:38,649
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

194
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,570
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

195
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,951
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

196
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,079
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

197
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:58,586
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

198
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,214
...before this is over.

199

The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

200

I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

I wish none of this had happened.

202
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:26,280
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

203
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:32,620
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

204
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:38,125
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

205
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,920
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

-This way!

645
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,802
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!

646
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:43,899
[HORN BLOWS]

647
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:47,236
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.

648
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,447
Run!

649
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,629
[ARROW HITS]

650
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:04,660
No.

651
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,541
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.

652
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,960
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

653
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,255
I let Frodo go.

654
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:20,550
Then you did what I could not.

655
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:24,888
I tried to take the Ring from him.

656
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:29,685
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.

657
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:32,187
I did not see it.

658
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:35,565
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.

659
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,568
You fought bravely.

660
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,530
You have kept your honor.

661
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:44,032
BOROMIR:
Leave it.

662
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:46,410
It is over.

663
01:26:47,577 --> 01:26:52,874
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...

664
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:56,294
...and my city to ruin.

665
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:03,093
I do not know what strength
is in my blood...

666
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:07,264
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

667
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,767
...nor our people fail.

668
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,103
Our people.

669
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:19,067
Our people.

670
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:43,800
I would have followed you, my brother.

671
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,345
My captain.

672
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,933
My king.

673
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,830
Be at peace...

674
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:16,166
...son of Gondor.

675
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:36,019
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

676
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:39,523
But he will not return.

677
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:04,714
Frodo!

678
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:27,445
FRODO:
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

679
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:31,741
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

680
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,455
GANDALF: <i>So do all who live
to see such times...</i>

681
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:41,084
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

682
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,920
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

683
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:48,925
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

684
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,789
Frodo, no!

685
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:21,625
Frodo!

686
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:25,128
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

687
01:30:28,632 --> 01:30:30,634
Go back, Sam!

688
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:34,721
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

689
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,766
And I'm coming with you!

690
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,644
You can't swim!

691
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,149
Sam!

692
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:53,031
Sam!

693
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,700
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

694
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:41,371
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

695
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,083
And I don't mean to.

696
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,544
I don't mean to.

697
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:51,047
Sam.

698
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,564
Come on.

699
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:40,597
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

700
01:32:55,445 --> 01:33:00,450
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

701
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:08,792
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

702
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:23,807
Not if we hold true to each other.

703
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:29,646
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

704
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:35,902
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

705
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:39,197
We travel light.

706
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:41,324
Let us hunt some Orc.

707
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:46,329
Yes!

01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,724
FRODO:
Mordor.

709
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:10,728
I hope the others find a safer road.

710
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:14,232
Strider will look after them.

711
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:18,528
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

712
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:21,322
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

713
01:34:21,531 --> 01:34:23,032
We may.

714
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,202
Sam...

715
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:32,458
...I'm glad you are with me.
