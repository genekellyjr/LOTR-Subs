FRODO:
All right.

We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

Do they, Gandalf?

There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

You'll have to leave the name

That name is not safe

I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1346
02:08:21,387 --> 02:08:25,349
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

1347

Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

1348
02:08:29,061 --> 02:08:34,984

part to play yet, for good or ill...

may rule the fate of many.

had never come to me.

...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...

1862
03:12:44,663 --> 03:12:47,165
...nor our people fail.

1863
03:12:48,166 --> 03:12:49,501
Our people.

1864
03:12:53,338 --> 03:12:55,465
Our people.

1865
03:13:17,195 --> 03:13:20,198
I would have followed you, my brother.

1866
03:13:21,741 --> 03:13:23,743
My captain.

1867
03:13:26,371 --> 03:13:28,331
My king.

1868
03:13:47,976 --> 03:13:50,228
Be at peace...

1869
03:13:50,562 --> 03:13:52,564
...son of Gondor.

1870
03:14:09,080 --> 03:14:12,417
They will look for his coming
from the White Tower.

1871
03:14:12,918 --> 03:14:15,921
But he will not return.

1872
03:14:39,110 --> 03:14:41,112
Frodo!

1873
03:15:00,590 --> 03:15:03,843
FRODO:
<i>I wish the Ring had never come to me.</i>

1874
03:15:05,136 --> 03:15:08,139
<i>I wish none of this had happened.</i>

1875
03:15:11,101 --> 03:15:13,853
GANDALF: <i>So do all who live
to see such times...</i>

1876
03:15:14,062 --> 03:15:17,482
<i>...but that is not for them to decide.</i>

1877
03:15:17,649 --> 03:15:20,318
<i>All you have to decide...</i>

1878
03:15:20,568 --> 03:15:25,323
...is what to do with the time
that is given to you.

1879
03:15:54,144 --> 03:15:56,187
Frodo, no!

1880
03:15:56,688 --> 03:15:58,023
Frodo!

1881
03:15:58,857 --> 03:16:01,526
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.

1882
03:16:05,030 --> 03:16:07,032
Go back, Sam!

1883
03:16:07,532 --> 03:16:11,119
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.

1884
03:16:11,328 --> 03:16:14,164
And I'm coming with you!

1885
03:16:14,622 --> 03:16:17,042
You can't swim!

1886
03:16:20,837 --> 03:16:22,547
Sam!

1887
03:16:28,136 --> 03:16:29,429
Sam!

1888
03:17:10,387 --> 03:17:13,098
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1889
03:17:13,431 --> 03:17:17,769
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1890
03:17:18,895 --> 03:17:21,481
And I don't mean to.

1891
03:17:21,773 --> 03:17:23,942
I don't mean to.

1892
03:17:25,610 --> 03:17:27,445
Sam.

1893
03:17:42,293 --> 03:17:43,962
Come on.

1894
03:18:12,449 --> 03:18:16,995
Hurry! Frodo and Sam
have reached the eastern shore.

1895
03:18:31,843 --> 03:18:36,848
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1896
03:18:40,310 --> 03:18:45,190
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.

1897
03:18:57,035 --> 03:19:00,205
Not if we hold true to each other.

1898
03:19:01,539 --> 03:19:06,044
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin
to torment and death.

1899
03:19:07,045 --> 03:19:12,300
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1900
03:19:13,551 --> 03:19:15,595
We travel light.

1901
03:19:15,803 --> 03:19:17,722
Let us hunt some Orc.

1902
03:19:20,683 --> 03:19:22,727
Yes!

1903
03:19:41,704 --> 03:19:43,122
FRODO:
Mordor.

1904
03:19:43,748 --> 03:19:47,126
I hope the others find a safer road.

1905
03:19:48,086 --> 03:19:50,630
Strider will look after them.

1906
03:19:51,589 --> 03:19:54,926
I don't suppose
we'll ever see them again.

1907
03:19:55,260 --> 03:19:57,720
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1908
03:19:57,929 --> 03:19:59,430
We may.

1909
03:20:01,558 --> 03:20:02,600
Sam...

1910
03:20:06,229 --> 03:20:08,856
...I'm glad you are with me.

1911
03:48:06,074 --> 03:48:08,076
