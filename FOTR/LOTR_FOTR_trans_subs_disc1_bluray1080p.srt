FRODO:
All right.

We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

Do they, Gandalf?

There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the Ring.

I looked everywhere
for the creature Gollum.

...I would use this Ring
from a desire to do good.

You'll have to leave the name

That name is not safe

I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.

...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

His strength returns.

That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

And yet to have come so far
still bearing the Ring...

...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

957

-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.

than you know.

By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.

964

He's breeding an army
in the caverns of Isengard.

An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

Saruman is coming for the Ring.

967

This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the Elves.

968

We do not have the strength
to fight both Mordor and Isengard!

The Dwarves?

975

They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

976
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:37,325
It is in Men
that we must place our hope.

Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.

The blood of Númenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

It is because of Men

One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1092
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:16,380
Its Black Gates are guarded
by more than just Orcs.

1093
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:21,344
There is evil there
that does not sleep.

1094
01:42:21,552 --> 01:42:25,765
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.

1095
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,559
It is a barren wasteland...

1096
01:42:28,768 --> 01:42:32,396
...riddled with fire, and ash
and dust.

1097
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:36,400
The very air you breathe
is a poisonous fume.

1098
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:40,905
Not with 10,000 men
could you do this. It is folly.

1099
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:45,576
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond
has said? The Ring must be destroyed.

1100
01:42:45,785 --> 01:42:48,412
And I suppose you think
you are the one to do it!

1101
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:53,250
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1102
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:58,756
I will be dead before I see the Ring
in the hands of an Elf!

1103
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:00,549
[SHOUTING]

1104
01:43:00,758 --> 01:43:03,260
Never trust an Elf!

1105
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:10,267
GANDALF: Do you not understand?
While you bicker, Sauron's power grows!

1106
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,437
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1107
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:16,787
THE RING: <i> One Ring to rule them all...
(Ash Nazg durbatulûk...)</i>

1108
01:43:16,812 --> 01:43:18,821
<i>...One Ring to find them...
(...Ash Nazg gimbatul...)</i>

1109
01:43:18,845 --> 01:43:21,347
<i>One Ring to rule them all...
(Ash Nazg durbatulûk...)</i>

1110
01:43:21,371 --> 01:43:23,534
<i>...One Ring to find them...
(...Ash Nazg gimbatul...)</i>

1111
01:43:23,559 --> 01:43:25,729
<i>One Ring to rule them all...
(Ash Nazg durbatulûk...)</i>

1112
01:43:25,753 --> 01:43:27,869
<i>...One Ring to find them...
(...Ash Nazg gimbatul...)</i>

1113
01:43:27,893 --> 01:43:29,582
<i>One Ring to rule them all...
(Ash Nazg durbatulûk...)</i>

1114
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:34,458
I will take it.

1115
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,963
I will take it.

1116
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,847
I will take the Ring to Mordor.

1117
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:57,148
Though...

1118
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:02,069
...I do not know the way.

1119
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:08,409
I will help you bear
this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1120
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:11,954
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1121
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,167
If by my life
or death I can protect you...

1122
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:18,252
...I will.

1123
01:44:21,464 --> 01:44:23,758
You have my sword.

1124
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,678
And you have my bow.

1125
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:30,765
And my ax.

1126
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:40,775
You carry the fates
of us all, little one.

1127
01:44:42,777 --> 01:44:46,447
If this is indeed
the will of the Council...

1128
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:49,325
-...then Gondor will see it done.
-Hey!

1129
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:56,707
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardly possible to separate you...

1130
01:44:56,916 --> 01:45:01,796
...even when he is summoned
to a secret Council and you are not.

1131
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,256
We're coming too!

1132
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:09,136
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1133
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,723
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1134
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:14,391
...mission.

1135
01:45:14,558 --> 01:45:16,060
Quest.

1136
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:17,561
Thing.

1137
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:22,066
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1138
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:25,569
Nine companions.

1139
01:45:27,404 --> 01:45:29,240
So be it.

1140
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:32,576
You shall be
the Fellowship of the Ring.

1141
01:45:33,244 --> 01:45:35,079
Great!

1142
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:37,581
Where are we going?
