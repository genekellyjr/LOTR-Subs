174

There are older

175
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,382
...in the deep places of the world.

176
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:05,311
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey
to the other side.

177
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,357
Let us hope that our presence
may go unnoticed.

178
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,823
The wealth of Moria is not in gold...

179
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,409
...or jewels...

180
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,620
...but mithril.

181
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:27,893
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

182
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:32,106
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.
-Yes.

183
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,150
I never told him...

184
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:39,280
...but its worth was greater than
the value of the Shire.

185
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,335
Pippin.

186
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,650
I have no memory of this place.

PIPPIN: Are we lost?
MERRY: No.

PIPPIN: Merry?
MERRY: What?

190
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,827
PIPPIN:
I'm hungry.

191
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,593
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.

192
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,931
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.

193
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,310
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
-Escaped...

194
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,646
...or was set loose.

195
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,817
Now the Ring has brought him here.

196
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,197
He will never be rid of his need for it.

197
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:09,119
He hates and loves the Ring,
as he hates and loves himself.

198
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:14,166
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

199
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:20,297
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.

200
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,009
Before it drove him mad.

201
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,179
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

202
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,556
Pity?

203
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,518
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

204
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:38,649
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

205
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,570
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

206
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:48,951
Do not be too eager
to deal out death and judgment.

207
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,079
Even the very wise
cannot see all ends.

208
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:58,586
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

209
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,214
...before this is over.

210
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:07,595
The pity of Bilbo
may rule the fate of many.

211
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,605
I wish the Ring
had never come to me.

212
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,066
I wish none of this had happened.

213
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:26,280
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

214
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:32,620
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

215
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:38,125
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

216
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,920
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.

217
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,758
In which case,
you also were meant to have it.

218
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:49,136

00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,761
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

323
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:20,556
By nightfall, these hills will
be swarming with Orcs.

324
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,102
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

325
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,314
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

326
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,984
On your feet, Sam.

327
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,820
Frodo?

328
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,615
Frodo!

329
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,670
Stay close, young Hobbits!

330
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:37,550
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

331
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,303
An Elf-witch...

332
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:43,723
...of terrible power.

333
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,475
All who look upon her...

334
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,477
...fall under her spell.

335
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,979
GALADRIEL:

336
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,275
And are never seen again.

337
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:58,988
GALADRIEL: <i> Your coming to us is
as the footsteps of doom.</i>

338
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,909
<i>You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.</i>

339
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,869
SAM:
Mr. Frodo?

340
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:15,755
Well, here's one Dwarf
she won't ensnare so easily.

341
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:20,509
I have the eyes of a hawk
and the ears of a fox.

342
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:32,772
The Dwarf breathes so loud,
we could have shot him in the dark.

343
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:39,987
[IN SINDARIN] (Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.)

So much for the legendary courtesy
of the Elves!

Speak words we can all understand!

350
00:45:55,461 --> 00:46:00,049
[IN ENGLISH] We have not had dealings
with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.

351
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,843
And you know what this Dwarf
says to that?

352
00:46:03,118 --> 00:46:07,213
[IN KHUZDÛL] I spit upon your grave.
(Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul.)

353
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,727
That was not so courteous.

354
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:22,321
You bring great evil with you.

355
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:26,284
You can go no further.

356

(Merin le telim.)

363
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,341
The road is too dangerous.
(Andelu i ven.)

364
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,198
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

365
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,201
Nor would he have you give up hope.

366
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:14,040
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

367
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,044
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

368
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,049
You will follow me.

369
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,729
Caras Galadhon.

370
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:40,316
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

371
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:46,155
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

372
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:08,279
The enemy knows you have entered here.

373
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:14,118
What hope you had in secrecy
is now gone.

374
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:20,291
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

375
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,334
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

376
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,671
For I much desire to speak with him.

377
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,632
I can no longer see him from afar.

378
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:34,680
GALADRIEL: Gandalf the Grey did not
pass the borders of this land.

379
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,349
He has fallen into Shadow.

380
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:46,567
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.

381
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:51,947
A Balrog of Morgoth.

382
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,035
For we went needlessly
into the net of Moria.

383
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,373
Needless were none of the deeds
of Gandalf in life.

384
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:05,336
We do not yet know his full purpose.

385
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,386
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

386
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,014
...Gimli, son of Glóin.

387
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,560
For the world has grown
full of peril...

388
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,689
...and in all lands...

389
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,360
...love is now mingled with grief.

390
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,708
What now becomes of this Fellowship?

391
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:48,254
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

392
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,510
The quest stands upon the edge
of a knife.

393
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,763
Stray but a little and it will fail...

394
00:50:58,514 --> 00:51:01,350
...to the ruin of all.

395
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:11,527
Yet hope remains
while the Company is true.

396
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,783
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

397
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:21,912
...for you are weary with sorrow
and much toil.

00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,936

has been growing in my mind.

Something draws near.
I can feel it.

Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.

Where's Frodo?

632
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,735
BOROMIR:
None of us should wander alone.

633
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,238
You, least of all.

634
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,908
So much depends on you.

635

Frodo?

636
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:26,587
I know why you seek solitude.

637
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,758
You suffer. I see it day by day.

638
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,595
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

639
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,808
There are other ways, Frodo.

640
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:42,853
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.

641
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:46,857
It would seem like wisdom
but for the warning in my heart.

642
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:50,194
Warning? Against what?

643
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,488
We're all afraid, Frodo.

644
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:56,325
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

645

-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.

01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:05,459
I ask only for the strength
to defend my people!

-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.

-You are not yourself.

They will take the Ring.

before the end!

It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

654
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,326
It should be mine! Give it to me!

-Give it to me!
-No!

-No.

You will take the Ring to Sauron!

You will betray us!
