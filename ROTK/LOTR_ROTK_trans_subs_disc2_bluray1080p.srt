01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:42,769
<i>What are these tears
Upon your face?</i>

836
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:47,983
<i>Soon you will see</i>

837
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:53,113
<i>All of your fears
Will pass away</i>

838

<i>On the horizon?</i>

842
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:18,305
<i>Why do the white gulls</i>

843
01:56:18,472 --> 01:56:23,185
<i>Call?</i>

844

<i>And you'll be here
In my arms</i>
