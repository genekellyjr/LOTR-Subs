01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,771
War is coming.

659
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,525
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

660
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,111
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

661
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,990
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

662
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:45,243
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

663
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,123
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

664
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,084
But for all their cunning...

665
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,837
...we have one advantage.

666
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,550
The Ring remains hidden.

667
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,553
And that we should seek to destroy it...

668
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,681
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

669
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,602
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

670
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:12,270
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

671
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:16,524
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

672
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,319
We must trust now in Frodo.

676

-No, from the North.

Two serpents with emerald eyes.

One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.
